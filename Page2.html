            <h2>What is HTML (HyperText Markup Language)?</h2>
            <p>HTML is also known as HyperText Markup. This language is not a Programming language but is a markup language. It is mainly used for coding 
                the front end aspects of a webpage or an application. The first html version (HTML-1) was first released in 1993. The version that is
                currently used is HTML-5. As a matter of fact, the contents of this page are also being written using HTML 
                and are being styled using Cascading Style Sheets! There are many cool things that one can do using HTML such as insert images along 
                with writing text and make forms with different input types. All the content in HTML is written using tags. Some examples of tags are &ltheader&gt, 
                &ltfooter&gt, &ltbody&gt, &ltmain&gt, &lthead&gt. These tags describe what the content enclosed within them is. For example, the footer 
                tag contains the footer of the web such as the copyright mark and links to to other locations within the same website.  </p>
